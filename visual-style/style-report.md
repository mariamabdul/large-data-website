#Style Report

##Style 1- For this style I chose colours of fall, since my website is about Falcons, I thought that the colours of fall may fit in this region as to the Falcons are in nature and fall is part of the seasons in nature.  As for the textures I chose ones that work well with the colours of fall such as thw ood with the brown colours. The cons would be that the colours are very subtle and may not be fun and clean to naviagte through in a website.##Style 2-For this style I chose colours that are also foun in nature. These are fresh clean colours that work well for an animal website. The colours being used give it a modern look. This would attract the viewers more of any age. The textures i used relate to the colours such as the sky. The navigation is very fun with the different colours. ##Style 3-For this style I chose colours that contrast somehow and still give you a feel for nature and animals. The textures used are sand rocks and bird fur to help match the overall theme. the con would be having 3 completely different colours.**I chose style 2 beacuse I thought its the most modern style and would work very well with my topic. Although it doesnt have the brownish colours of nature, it still has the sky blue and grass green. It looks fresh, clean and modern, these are the most things that viewers like nowadays.**
