# Falcons

Falcons are medium sized birds of prey found all across the world although falcons tend to prefer the more temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Falcons are best known for their ruthlessness and their incredible flying abilities.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
