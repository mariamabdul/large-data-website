## The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital
The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the world's foremost falcon welfare institution,[1] [2] and the first of its kind.[3] It opened on 3 October 1999, as an affiliate of the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency, since when it has been directed by German veterinary surgeon Dr Margit Gabriele MÃ¼ller and has become one of the largest avian hospitals.

The hospital operates under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.[5] It has proven itself one of Abu Dhabi's major tourist attractions. In 2010 it was visited by U.S. Ambassador Richard Olson.

### Description
The hospital has individual air-conditioned rooms for over 200 birds. Each year about 6,000 falcons enter its care. It offers annual check-ups because it is often difficult to recognise whether a falcon has a health issue. [9] The staff is experienced in treating everything they might diagnose. Even the birds' feathers are carefully scrutinised. As visitors learn during the popular tours a falcon's flight gets significantly unbalanced when they lose even a single flight feather. Consequently it is standard treatment to repair or substitute lost feathers by those kept in stock.

### Passports
Since the United Arab Emirates introduced falcon passports it is the ADFH's prerogative to issue them.

### Animal Shelter
The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital also manages an animal shelter. This is based on the approval of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council of the Abu Dhabi government.[12] The facility can accommodate hundreds of stray dogs and cats.
